# Fixed security misconfigurations (SSL stripping, obsolete ciphers)
Fix - generate new server certificate and server key with 2048 key length and SHA2 algorithm.
Before fix, this is shown.
SSL Certificate:
Signature algorithm : SHA1WithRSAEncryption
RSA key length : 1024

After fix, this is shown.
SSL Certificate:
Signature algorithm : SHA2WithRSAEncryption
RSA key length : 2048


# Fixed security misconfigurations (SSL stripping, obsolete ciphers)
Fix - Removed weak ciphers
Before fix, weak 64 bits key length still in use.
After fix, no more weak 64 bit keys in cipher suite.
