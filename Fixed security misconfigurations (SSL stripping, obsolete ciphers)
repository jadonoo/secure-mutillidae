# Fixed security misconfigurations (SSL stripping, obsolete ciphers)
Fix - generate new server certificate and server key with 2048 key length and SHA2 algorithm.
Before fix, this is shown.
SSL Certificate:
Signature algorithm : SHA1WithRSAEncryption
RSA key length : 1024

After fix, this is shown.
SSL Certificate:
Signature algorithm : SHA2WithRSAEncryption
RSA key length : 2048


# Fixed obsolete ciphers
Fix - Removed weak ciphers
Before fix, weak 64 bits key length still in use.
After fix, no more weak 64 bit keys in cipher suite.


# Fixed SSL stripping
Fix - applied this code.
	if (isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] === 'on') {  // check if the connection is on HTTPS
	header('Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains', true);  //then force all future connections to use HTTPS for 1 year including subdomains
    }

Before fix - max-age=0 was shown when inspect SSL strict policy with brower developer tool.
After fix - max-age=31536000 was shown when inspect SSL strict policy with brower developer tool.
