# Fixed unstricted file upload in http://localhost/mutillidae/index.php?page=upload-file.php page.
Fix - applied this code.
if (!in_array($lFileType, $lAllowedFileTypes)) { // if file type is not in allowed list
	$lValidationMessage .= " File type {$lFileType} is NOT ALLOWED."; // show this message to user
	$lFileValid = false; // reject file uploading if wrong file type

Before fix, accept any files to be uploaded.
After fix,  no longer accepted wrong file type uploading.
